# OpenShift

## About

This repository is created for the purpose of learning OpenShift. It will contain some sample applications and some notes.
I will also try to create a guide and some scripts to automate the process of creating a cluster on your local server.

As I am learning OpenShift, I will be updating this repository with new information and new scripts. I will also try to keep the scripts as generic as possible so that they can be used in various environments.
