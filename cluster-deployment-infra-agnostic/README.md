# Openshift Cluster Deployment

## About

I believe that the best way to learn something is to do it. So, I decided to automate the process of creating an OpenShift cluster on my local server. As the process of creating a cluster is quite complex, I decided to create a guide and some scripts to automate the process. The benefit of this is that I can easily create a cluster. This makes it easier to experiment with OpenShift and I can also easily create a new cluster if I mess up the current one.
